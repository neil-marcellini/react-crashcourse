# TodoList
A simple to-do list app to learn the basics of react. [JSON placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) was used to simulate a backend REST api. I followed [this wonderful tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A&t=774s) from Traversy Media.

## Getting Started
Download the codebase and run npm start to run a development server.

## What I learned
I learned the basic structure of react components in both class and functional forms. Props are used to pass data between components, and PropTypes helps enforce that props are provided with the correct types. Inline style is written inside curly braces directly, and variables or functions can also be used for styling. CSS properties are written in camel case. Html and js are combined in the render function using JSX. The BrowserRouter can be used to simulate routing to new pages via link tags. I look forward to using react on more projects in the future!
